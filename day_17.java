// Implement Upper Bound
// Problem statement
// You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers and an integer ‘x’.Implement the ‘upper bound’ 
// function to find the index of the upper bound of 'x' in the array.



// Note:
// 1. The upper bound in a sorted array is the index of the first value that is greater than a given value. 
// 2. If the greater value does not exist then the answer is 'n', Where 'n' is the size of the array.
// 3. Try to write a solution that runs in log(n) time complexity.


// Example:

// Input : ‘arr’ = {2,4,6,7} and ‘x’ = 5,

// Output: 2

// Explanation: The upper bound of 5 is 6 in the given array, which is at index 2 (0-indexed).
public class day_17 {
    public static int upperBound(int []arr, int x, int n){

        int low =0, high = n-1, result = n;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid]>x){
                result = mid;
                high = mid-1;

            }else{
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return result;
